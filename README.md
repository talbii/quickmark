# Quickmark

**note: originally this project was a new markdown flavour, but I've decided to change this into something more... useful**

TLDR; `md` -> `html`

## Why

Without getting into too much of a ramble, I want to use markdown to write my blog posts, and currently Github Pages (which is what I'm using for my website) uses Jekyll for its theming, so markdown pages render differently then my website, which looks ugly.

Also good for performance, static websites and backwards compatibility/cross-platform support (most computers can't render markdown until you download some editor).

## Features

Out of the box, Quickmark supports Github-flavoured markdown, so don't worry about that. Apart from GFM, Quickmark also allows for theming and additional configurations: using Quickmark you can:

1. Config styling for compiling markdown: headings, paragraphs, code blocks, and more.
2. Automatically load additional scripts (such as MathJax, JQuery, Bootstrap), and get the latest version as needed
3. Switch between styling as needed: compile different files with different styling.

Check out the [documentation](docs.md) for additional information about that.
